# Simple Instructions
 - Build [HackerSM64](https://github.com/someone2639/ultrasm64-extbounds/tree/recomp) (the recomp branch) with `RECOMP=1`
 - From the HackerSM64 `build/us_n64` folder, copy `sm64.elf`, `sm64.z64`, and `rsp/audio.bin` to this repo. (running `./tools/import.sh <path/to/HackerSM64/>` will do this too)
 - Run `make`

# Advanced Instructions
 - Look at a different recomp repo lol
